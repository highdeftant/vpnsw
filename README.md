# vpnsw
Switches between London and Washingon, D.C locations using the PIA CLI

# Update v1.9
- Works fine in terminal, must turn off notifications in GUI to avoid slight spamming.

  Update v1.8
- This KINDA works now! What happens is, when initiating the command, the script will already try to change locations before waiting for your input from the read command.

  Update 1.7
- Added 'read' command with 'if' loop to get more direct input from PIA VPN.
- short update list, lol.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Update 1.5
- I have added the correct commands for switching locations in a function, and have tried to call those functions from a loop.
