# vpnsw
Switches between London and Washington, DC locations using the PIA CLI

# Update v1.9
- Added 'read' command with 'if' loop to get more direct input from PIA VPN.
- Works currently w/o notifications on. Will continue to update functions and if statements.

 Update v1.7
- This KINDA works now! What happens is, when initiating the command, the script will already try to change location

 Update 1.5
- I have added the correct commands for switching locations in a function, and have tried to call those functions from a loop.
