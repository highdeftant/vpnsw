# vpnsw
Switches between two locations using the PIA CLI

This is so broken it makes my head hurt

# Update v1.7
This KINDA works now! What happens is, when initiating the command, the script will already try to change locations before waiting for your input from the read command.

# Upcoming Updates...
Adding Script Arguments to test if that will correctly switch proxies

# Update 1.7
- Added 'read' command with 'if' loop to get more direct input from PIA VPN.
- short update list, lol.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Update 1.5
I have added the correct commands for switching locations in a function, and have tried to call those functions from a loop.
